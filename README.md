[Happy Hues](https://www.happyhues.co/) is my favorite site for curating colors.

But, it imports too many external libraries from:
+ cdn.rawgit.com (down)
+ assets.website-files.com
+ use.typekit.net
+ p.typekit.net
+ unpkg.com
+ cdnjs.cloudflare.com
+ d3e54v103j8qbb.cloudfront.net

Importing libraries reduces hosting presure, but it makes website unstable.

In order to make this site can be visited forever, I dump it, modify it and [host](https://c4710n.github.io/archived-happy-hues/) it.
